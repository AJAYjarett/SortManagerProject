#Project specification

This is a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:
1. The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from
2. Decision is given via the command line (Scanner)
3. The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line (Scanner)
4. The program should then output:
    - The unsorted randomly generated array
    - The sort algorithm to be used
    - The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
    - The time taken



this includes:
- BubbleSort
- MergeSort
- BinaryTreeSort
- QuickSort

#Instructions of use
